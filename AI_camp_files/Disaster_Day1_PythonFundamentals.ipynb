His passion for teaching will be an incredible benefit not only for our coaches, but also for the young men we are responsible for as students and athletes.”\"\n",

As humans increasingly share workspaces with robots, these softer versions offer a higher degree of safety and increased robotic capabilities. Soft, bio-inspired robots, which mimic animals like geckos, fish and octopuses — or humans — are able to adapt to solid, granular and fluid environments. The new materials used in the development of these robots are made possible by advanced printing and manufacturing techniques. According to Hamid Marvi, an ASU robotics professor whose research investigates the physics of biological systems, these developments will improve robotic support for search and rescue, medical applications and earth and space exploration.\"\n"
